# A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets

My attempt at replication Hinton's et al paper on DBNs. Hopefully better
understanding RBNs and DBNs in the process.

paper: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/fastnc.pdf

The MNIST dataset is used. DBN network Topology (784)-(500)-(500+10)-(2000).
